# ShinyApp-and-Reproducible-Pitch-
Comes from Course Project: Shiny Application and Reproducible Pitch

The application is drawing plot of diamonds in the `diamonds` data set distributed by their size (carat) and price ($). The regression line is shown on the plot as well. 

By selecting specific features of the diamond (carat, cut, clarity, color) the user is able to sub select the data set and the regression is recalculated based only on the diamonds in the data set that share the same features. If no features are selected the regression model is using all diamonds in the data set.

the application predicts the *price of a diamond based on its characteristics.
*All other available prices are displayed in the chat
